# CuckooHash
Implementation of a Cuckoo Hash data structure with worst case O(1)lookup. 
The class contains:
- insertion method 
- deletion method
- search method
- increment method (increments the data of the corresponding keydata pair by one, or it adds a new keydata pair with 1 as the data)

The program already contains a large amount of thorough pytests that test each method in the class.
